* Create a BWA index for the reference: 
bwa index S288C_reference_sequence_R64-2-1_20150113.fsa

* Map the cleaned RM11 reads (after trimmomatic and fastuniq from EX 3) to the S288C reference: 
bwa mem -t 8 S288C_reference_sequence_R64-2-1_20150113.fsa output_r1 output_r2 > rm11_reads.sam

Q1: First I ran "samtools view rm11_reads.sam | wc" to get the number of records (=reads): 3191266.
Then I ran "samtools view -f 2 rm11_reads.sam | wc" to filter the sam file 
for records that have their second bit enabled. The line count 
(which is the number of reads that were mapped in proper pair) is 3124581.
Hence, the fraction is: 3124581 / 3191266 = 0.9791

Q2: I ran "samtools view -f 2 -q 30 rm11_reads.sam | wc" to get the number of records and got 2764296.
Hence, the fraction is 2764296 / 3191266 = 0.8662

* Create a BAM file containing only reads which pass the filtration criteria:
samtools view -bh -f 2 -q 30 rm11_reads.sam > rm11_reads_filtered.bam

* Sort BAM file:
samtools sort rm11_reads_filtered.bam > rm11_reads_filtered_sorted.bam

* Create a BAM index:
samtools index rm11_reads_filtered_sorted.bam

* Calculate statistics:
samtools stats rm11_reads_filtered_sorted.bam > rm11_reads_filtered_sorted.stats

Q3: 0 pairs are mapped on different chromosomes.
I created a BAM file containing all reads with "samtools view -bh rm11_reads.sam > rm11_reads_all.bam",
and sorted, indexed the sorted file and calculated statistics.
Now 5224 read pairs were mapped on different chromosomes.

Q4: I examined different locations across the coverage track and I estimate the depth to be around 25 on average.

Q5: paired-reads colored in red mean that the insert size is too big, 
and paired-reads colored in blue mean that the insert size is too small 
(many times to the level that the reads are overlapping)

Q6: reads with suspected sequencing errors are probably those that that have variance in comparison to other reads.
Real SNPs are those that all the reads have the same base and it's different from the reference genome.
