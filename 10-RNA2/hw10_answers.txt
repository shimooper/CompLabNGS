Preparing count matrix:

I ran the command:
featureCounts -a S288C_reference_annotation_proc.gtf -o counts.tsv -s 2 -t exon -g transcript_id *.bam

Q1: the "-s 2" flag means we perform strand-specific counting - we count only reads on the reveresed strand.
Q2: "-t exon" means the features we are interesed in are exons from the  GTF annotation file. The reads that are counted are the ones which are mapped to exons.
"-g transcript_id" means we want to use the "transcript_id" attribute to identify the rows in the output matrix.

Q3: there are 6697 transcripts in the counts.tsv output.

Differential gene expression analysis:

Q4: After filtering, I was left with 2765 transcripts.

Q5: the samples clustered together exactly the way we wished - all 3 samples from the same strain are almost identical (for both strains).
We don't see a batch effect.

Q6:
Geneid - the ID of each transcript from the GTF annotation file
baseMean - ?
log2FoldChange - log2(mean of S288C counts / mean of RM11 counts)
lfcSE - ?
stat - the Wals statistics
pvalue - the pvalue indicating the significance of the difference between the strains
padj - the adjusted pvalue after FDR correction

Q7: there are 225 genes that have Log2FoldChange > 1 and adjusted p-value < 0.05

Q9: Using the cutoffs specified, there are 252 DE genes.

Q10: There are 108 genes that were expressed higher in RM11

Q11: There are 144 genes that were expressed higher in S288C

Q12: Increasing padj_cutoff will lead to more genes "passing" the significance threshold.
Increasing lfc_cutoff will lead to less genes "passing" the FoldChange threshold.
