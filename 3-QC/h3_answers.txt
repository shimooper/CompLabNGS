Q1: 
The header of the first read in R1 is:
@SRR1569760.2151832 D4LHBFN1:249:D292YACXX:8:1207:15788:92582/1
The header of the first read in R2 is:
@SRR1569760.2151832 D4LHBFN1:249:D292YACXX:8:1207:15788:92582/2

As we can see, the headers are the same except for the last character which indicates if
it belongs to R1 or R2.

Q2:
I used "zcat data/SRR1569760_sub_1.fastq.gz | head -n 4" to view the first read in R1,
and then copied the sequence and ran "echo -n <sequence> | wc -c" to get its length.
The read length is 101.
To find the number of reads, I used: "zcat data/SRR1569760_sub_1.fastq.gz | grep @SRR1569760 | wc",
and found that both R1 adn R2 contain 1782180 reads.
Overall we have 1782180*2 reads of length 101, so according to D=(L*N)/G, and assuming G=12Mb,
we get that D (sequencing depth) = 30

Q3:
The plot "Per base sequence content" is suspicious - we see that the content of the 
start of the reads isn't distibuted according to the expected constant distribution across the genome.
There are no significant differences between R1 and R2.

Q4:
The command I ran is:
trimmomatic PE data/SRR1569760_sub_1.fastq.gz data/SRR1569760_sub_2.fastq.gz -baseout trimmomatic_results/output ILLUMINACLIP:data/NexteraPE-PE.fa:2:30:10 HEADCROP:20 MINLEN:70

First, I used ILLUMINACLIP to trim adapter sequences since the fastqc report showed they exist.
Then, this operation resulted in having some reads which are very short, so I removed them with MINLEN (applied last according to the guidelines given in the lecture).
Also, I decided to cut the first 20 bp of all reads because of the plot "Per base sequence content", and I used the module HEADCROP for that.
I didn't apply any module to trim low-quality bases since the fastqc report showed that there aren't such bases.

Q5:
After cleanup, I was left with 1642999*2 reads of length 81, so the sequencing depth is:
(L*N)/G = 81*1642999*2/12M = 22.2

Bonus section:
I ran fastuniq to remove duplicated from the clean paired reads, and ran fastqc again on the results,
and indeed saw that the plots "Sequence Duplication Levels" are a bit better 
(the distribution is more skwed to small duplication level)
